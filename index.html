And if you were to edit your program, feel free to share it with us! Since we are using GitHub as our repository host you can create a pull request and we'll take a look at it, and if we like it we'll incorporate your edits into the program. We will of course make sure you will get the credits for it, and as a bonus you'll get access to the beta versions of the program. Additionally, if this program ever were to cost money we'll of course send you a free copy.</p>

You can either drop us a mail, or use the <a href="https://github.com/Tijndagamer/C-Mail/issues">integrated bug tracker on GitHub</a>. As it makes the whole job a lot easier for us developers we would like if you could report all the bugs using the bug tracker on GitHub, but if you don't have an acc. or similar you can drop us a mail (<em>Please see the contact page for more information</em>). As we are no C# gurus (<em>yet</em>) we can't help you with all your problems, and that is why we need to help each other.</p>

We are looking for young developers that will work on projects and at the same time increase their skill in programming. As of right now we're not developing any products other than C-Mail, we do not have any deadlines or similar since both of us attend to school and have limited time.
